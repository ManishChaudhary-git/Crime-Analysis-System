# Crime Analysis System

A simple Python project for crime data exploration and analysis. This repository currently contains a single script:

- `Crime_ex.py`: Main entry point for the analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (tested on Windows)

## Quick Start (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
# Optionally create and activate a virtual environment
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# If you add dependencies later, install them with:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python Crime_ex.py
```

## Project Structure
```
Crime_ex.py
```

## Development Notes
- If you later introduce third‑party libraries, add a `requirements.txt` and update this README accordingly.
- Consider organizing modules into folders as the project grows (e.g., `src/`, `data/`, `notebooks/`).
